This repository contains the code and minimal assets to reproduce the pathway analysis and overlap visualizations across three public studies (GSE102924, GSE114907, GSE234128). Analyses use pre-ranked GSEA via fgsea on all tested genes, ranking by the DESeq2 Wald statistic (signed, direction-aware). Figures show the union of each studyâ€™s top 10 significant pathways by NES; the complete results, including the set of 75 shared pathways, are exported to Supplementary tables.
